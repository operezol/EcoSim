# EcoSim

**Description:** EcoSim is a forest ecosystem simulation game that teaches players about the importance of conservation. The goal of the game is to maintain the balance of the ecosystem for as long as possible. Players can interact with the ecosystem through a menu of options. The ecosystem is populated by a variety of organisms, including plants, herbivores, carnivores, and fungi. The organisms interact with each other in a realistic way. Players must overcome a series of challenges to maintain the balance of the ecosystem. The game has an educational component that teaches players about the importance of biodiversity, the fragility of ecosystems, and the effects of human activity on ecosystems.
