# EcoSim

**Description:** EcoSim will be a realistic, scalable, and modular ecosystem simulation game that teaches players about the importance of conservation. Players will be able to choose to manage an ecosystem of any size, from a small pond to a large forest. They will also be able to create their own custom ecosystems and challenges. EcoSim will be accessible to players of all ages and skill levels, and it will be available on a variety of platforms.

**Features:**

* EcoSim will simulate the interactions between different organisms and the environment in a realistic way.
* EcoSim will allow players to manage ecosystems of any size, from small ponds to large forests.
* EcoSim will use a modular design that will allow players to create their own custom ecosystems and challenges.
* EcoSim will be accessible to players of all ages and skill levels.
* EcoSim will be available on a variety of platforms.

**MVP Section**

The MVP (minimum viable product) for EcoSim will include the following features:

* Core ecosystem simulation mechanics: EcoSim will be able to simulate the interactions between a small set of plants and animals in an ecosystem, including the effects of predation, competition, and reproduction.
* Basic ecosystem management tools: Players will be able to make basic decisions about how to manage the ecosystem, such as planting trees, building ponds, and hunting predators.
* A simple goal system: Players will have a set of simple goals to achieve, such as maintaining the ecosystem balance for a certain period of time or protecting a specific species from extinction.

This MVP will allow us to test the core gameplay mechanics and get feedback from players early in the development process. Once we have a solid foundation, we can start adding more features and complexity to the game.

**Modifications for the definition phase**

Since the game is still in the definition phase, we may need to make some modifications to the MVP features. For example, we may decide to focus on simulating a specific type of ecosystem, such as a pond or a forest. We may also decide to limit the number of features that are available to players in the MVP.

The most important thing is to focus on the core gameplay mechanics and to get feedback from players early and often. This will help us to create a game that is fun and engaging for everyone.

**Conclusion:**

EcoSim will be a powerful and versatile ecosystem simulation game that can be used for a variety of purposes, including education, research, and entertainment. It will be a valuable tool for anyone who wants to learn more about ecosystems and conservation.

**Where to play:**

EcoSim is not yet available to play, but we will post a link to the game on our website and social media pages once it is ready.
